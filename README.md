              (iii)  Implementation phase which involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications
              (iv)   Testing phase which involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
              (v)    Deployment which means releasing the software to the intended users and collecting feedback
              (vi)   Maintenance phase which involves roviding ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment to ensure seamless experience.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
**COMPARISON AND CONTRAST**
Waterfall Methodology
    Tasks are completed in sequence, one after another and extensive documentation is created before any development work begins.
    Requirements are defined upfront and cannot be changed during the project.
    Projects are planned with specific deadlines and milestones.
    Considerable time and resources are invested in planning and documentation. Calls for highb upfront investment.

Agile Methodology
    Iterative: Work is broken down into small increments called sprints.
    Customer-centric as they are actively involved throughout the project.
    Flexibility in such a way that the requirements can be revised and adapted as the project progresses.
    Continuous improvement as the team regularly evaluates and improves their processes.
    Incremental delivery as features are delivered in small, working increments.

**Scenarios for Each Methodology**
Waterfall methodology is appropriate when:
    (i)    Requirements are stable and unlikely to change significantly.
    (ii)   The project is small and simple enough to be planned in detail upfront.
    (iii)  Strict deadlines and milestones are essential.
    (iv)   Documentation is critical for regulatory or legal purposes.

Examples Scenario:
    Development of a software application with well-defined requirements

Agile methodology is appropriate when:
    (i)    Requirements are likely to evolve or change during the project.
    (ii)   Customer feedback is crucial for shaping the product.
    (iii)  Flexibility and adaptability are essential.
    (iv)   Continuous improvement is desired.

Example scenario:
    Development of a software application that requires ongoing user input and management of a complex project with multiple stakeholders
